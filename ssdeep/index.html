<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
ssdeep is a program for computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH).
Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies.
Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length.
</p>
<p>
A complete explanation of CTPH can be found in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diin.2006.06.015">Identifying almost identical files using context triggered piecewise hashing</a> from the journal Digital Investigation.
There is a free version of this paper available through the Digital Forensic Research Workshop conference,
<a href="http://dfrws.org/2006/proceedings/12-Kornblum.pdf">free version of Identifying almost identical files using context triggered piecewise hashing.</a>
</p>
<p>
It also provides a library (libfuzzy) to generate/compare fuzzy hashes.
</p>
<p>
ssdeep hashes are now widely used for simple identification purposes. (e.g. Basic Properties section in <a href="https://virustotal.com/">VirusTotal</a>)
Although “better fuzzy hashes” are available, ssdeep is still one of the primary choices because of its speed (now about twice as fast as TLSH) and being a de facto standard.

<h2 id="platforms">Platforms</h2>
<ul>
<li>
	<p>Windows</p>
	<p>Download Windows (32-bit) binaries from <a href="https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep/releases">GitHub project page</a>.
	This binary package is tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10 (version 1703 - Creators Update).</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>Ubuntu</p>
	<p><a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/zesty/ssdeep">ssdeep package</a> is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>Fedora</p>
	<p><a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/ssdeep">ssdeep package</a> is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>Debian</p>
	<p><a href="https://packages.debian.org/stretch/ssdeep">ssdeep package</a> is available (<a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ssdeep">package tracker</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>CentOS (or other RHEL-based Linux distributions)</p>
	<p><a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/ssdeep/overview/">ssdeep package</a> on <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a> is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>Arch Linux</p>
	<p><a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ssdeep/">ssdeep package on AUR</a> is available (compilation is required but mostly automated).
	If you have <a href="https://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en/">yaourt</a> installed, you can build and install ssdeep automatically just like standard packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>FreeBSD</p>
	<p><a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/ssdeep/">security/ssdeep package on FreeBSD Ports</a> is available
	(compilation is required but easy).</p>
</li>
<li>
	<p>Other *nix platforms</p>
	<p>If the distribution you use does not provide ssdeep package, you will need to build it yourself.
	Download the source code from <a href="https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep/releases">GitHub project page</a> and install it.
	It should work at most of GNU Autotools-compatible environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>
ssdeep is available at <a href="https://github.com/ssdeep-project/ssdeep">GitHub</a>.
The latest version is 2.14.1 (released on 2017-11-07). You can take a look at the <a href="changes.txt">complete changelog</a>, but here are the changes in the latest version:
<ul>
<li>Optimizations to the fuzzy hashing engine (hash generator can run as twice as fast and comparison can run 1.5 through 5 times faster [heavily depends on the data and platform] than the previous release)</li>
<li>Fixed issue when certain memory allocation is failed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="people">People</h2>
<p>Let us introduce some of the people who gave major contributions to the program.</p>
<h3>Jesse Kornblum</h3>
<p>
ssdeep was originally written by Jesse Kornblum.
He created this useful program based on
original <a href="http://www.samba.org/ftp/unpacked/junkcode/spamsum/">spamsum</a> code by Dr. Andrew Trigdell and
kept this program improved for years.
</p>
<h3>Helmut Grohne</h3>
<p>
He mainly contributed to ssdeep version 2.10 and 2.11.
Thanks to his re-written fuzzy hashing engine, libfuzzy can now be used from multi-threaded programs
and is capable to process streams without seek capabilities.
</p>
<h3>Tsukasa OI</h3>
<p>
He is the current project maintainer and mainly contributed to ssdeep version 2.13 and 2.14.
He improved stability, portability and speed of the fuzzy hashing engine and also fixed major bugs.
